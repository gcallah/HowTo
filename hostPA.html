            Hosting a Class at PythonAnywhere

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>
            provides hosting services that, while focused on Python, certainly
            do not end there: one can also run shell, C, C++, awk, and Ruby
            programs with an account (as well as compiling C and C++
            programs).
        </p>

        <p>
            The relevance of this service to those who teach programming
            courses is that PA has special education services.
            Students can get free accounts, but even better than that,
            PA will create these accounts for you, and, even better,
            student accounts allow another account to be set as the
            instructor, and the instructor can log in and see the students
            work.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I used this service for my OS class, I simply sent PA a
            list of students Net IDs (to use as their login names) along
            with an account name for the TA who would be their supervisor.
            Once that was done, I could assign C coding, with no worries
            about setting up the compiler, getting mailed source code or
            executables, or complaints like "But it ran on my laptop!"
